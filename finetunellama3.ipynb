Swollen, cut lip bruised and cut knee, and hurt pride initially. Now have muscle and shoulder pain, stiff jaw(think this is from the really swollen lip),pain in wrist, and headache. I assume this is all normal but are there specific things I should look for or will I just be in pain for a while given the hard fall?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHello and welcome to HCM,The injuries caused on various body parts have to be managed.The cut and swollen lip has to be managed by sterile dressing.The body pains, pain on injured site and jaw pain should be managed by pain killer and muscle relaxant.I suggest you to consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment.In case there is evidence of infection in any of the injured sites, a course of antibiotics may have to be started to control the infection.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal<|eot_id|>'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-17T17:36:48.265646Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-17T17:36:48.265933Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-17T17:36:48.279480Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-17T17:36:48.265895Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-17T17:36:48.278699Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"training_arguments = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=new_model,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=1,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=1,\n    gradient_accumulation_steps=2,\n    optim=\"paged_adamw_32bit\",\n    num_train_epochs=1,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"steps\",\n    eval_steps=0.2,\n    logging_steps=1,\n    warmup_steps=10,\n    logging_strategy=\"steps\",\n    learning_rate=2e-4,\n    fp16=False,\n    bf16=False,\n    group_by_length=True,\n    report_to=\"wandb\"\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-17T17:37:05.999326Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-17T17:37:05.999656Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-17T17:37:06.030621Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-17T17:37:05.999631Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-17T17:37:06.029677Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/training_args.py:1575: FutureWarning: `evaluation_strategy` is deprecated and will be removed in version 4.46 of 🤗 Transformers.
