states and territories by gross domestic product (GDP). This article presents the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and their nominal GDP at current prices.\nThe data source for the list is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in 2024. The BEA defined GDP by state as \"the sum of value added from all industries in the state.\"\nNominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nOverall, in the calendar year 2024, the United States' Nominal GDP at Current Prices totaled at $29.017 trillion, as compared to $25.744 trillion in 2022.\nThe three U.S. states with the highest GDPs were California ($4.080 trillion), Texas ($2.695 trillion), and New York ($2.284 trillion). The three U.S. states with the lowest GDPs were Vermont ($45.4 billion), Wyoming ($53.0 billion), and Alaska ($69.8 billion).\nGDP per capita also varied widely throughout the United States in 2024, with New York ($117,332), Massachusetts ($110,561), and Washington (state) ($108,468) recording the three highest GDP per capita figures in the U.S., while Mississippi ($53,061), Arkansas ($60,276), and West Virginia ($60,783) recorded the three lowest GDP per capita figures in the U.S. The District of Columbia, though, recorded a GDP per capita figure far higher than any U.S. state in 2024 at $263,220.\n\n\n\nPage: List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\nSummary: This is a list of countries by nominal GDP per capita.\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. Measures of personal income include average wage, real income, median income, disposable income and GNI per capita.\nComparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries, see List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\nFor change of GDP per capita over time as a measure of economic growth, see real GDP growth and real GDP per capita growth.\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here (except Kosovo and Taiwan), but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in italics. Four UN members (Cuba, Liechtenstein, Monaco and North Korea) do not belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hence their economies are not ranked below. Kosovo, despite not being a member of the United Nations, is a member of IMF. Taiwan is not a IMF member but it is still listed in the official IMF indices.\nSeveral leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion\u001b[0m\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now have the information I need to answer the question.
